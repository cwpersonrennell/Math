<p><strong>Even Functions: </strong>An even function has the property that opposite inputs result in the <i>same</i> output. Algebraically, we say that \(f(x)\) is an even function if the following is true:</p>
\[ f(-x) = f(x) \]
<p><strong>Odd Functions: </strong>An odd function has the property that opposite inputs result in <i>opposite</i> outputs. Algebraically, we say that \(g(x)\) is an odd function if the following is true:</p>
\[ g(-x) = -g(x) \]
