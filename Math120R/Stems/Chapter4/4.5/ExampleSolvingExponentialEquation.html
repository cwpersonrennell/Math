<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
Use the definition of logarithm:
\[
\solve{
	5^{3x}&=&35\\
	3x&=&\log_5(35)\\
	x&=&\frac{\log_5(35)}{3}
}
\]
Now, this solution will be valid in most cases, but you should always keep an eye for possible simplifications. Logarithms have a lot of properties that allow for alternate ways to rewrite the answers. In this case:
\[
\solve{
	\frac{\log_5(35)}{3}&=&\frac{\log_5(5\times 7)}{3}\\
	&=&\frac{\log_5(5)+\log_5(7)}{3}\\
	&=&\frac{1+\log_5(7)}{3}\\
	&=&\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{3}\log_5(7)
}
\]
I also prefer to write logarithms with the fraction in front, when possible, since the power rule allows for yet more ways to play around with rewriting the answer. For now, I will leave our final answer as above.
