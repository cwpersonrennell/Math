<p>Example: The vertical height of a projectile launched from ground level with an initial velocity of \(25m/s\) can be modeled with the equation:</p>
\[ h(t) = 25\sin(\theta)t-4.9t^2 \]
<p>Where \(\theta\) is the launch angle and \(t\) is the time in seconds. Suppose the projectile needed to be 25 meters above the ground 2 seconds after launch. What angle should the projectile be launched at?</p>
