# Welcome

This site is structured around the course I teach at the University of Arizona, Math 120R - Calculus Preparation. Before we begin, I am going to restate the course goals here as I will occasionally make reference to these when it comes to motivating certain topics and approaches:

> - To prepare students to be successful in the Calculus sequence at U of A (math 122A/B, 129, and 223).
> - To help students develop and refine basic algebra skills by way of an integrated review of these skills as they are needed in the course.
> - To promote problem-solving and critical thinking skills through the application of algebraic concepts to common situations.
> - To enhance learning and understanding of algebraic concepts through the integrated use of graphing calculators.
> - To promote and utilize the "Rule of Four": all concepts are explored algebraically, numerically, graphically, and in context with applications.
> - To incorporate writing into the curriculum. Through writing about mathematics you will increase your understanding of mathematical concepts.
> - To help strengthen students' general academic skills.
