<p>Example: The vertical height of a projectile launched from ground level with an initial velocity of \(25m/s\) can be modeled with the equation:</p>
\[ h(t) = 25\sin(\theta)t-4.9t^2 \]
<p>Where \(\theta\) is the launch angle and \(t\) is the time in seconds. Suppose the projectile needed to be 25 meters above the ground 2 seconds after launch. What angle should the projectile be launched at?</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
To solve this, we set up the equation with the provided parameters:
\[
25 = 25\sin(\theta)\times(2)-4.9(2)^2
\]
We need to reorganize and solve this equation for \(\theta\):
\[
\solve{
	25   &=& 25\sin(\theta)\times 2-4.9\times 4\\
	25   &=& 50\sin(\theta)-24.6\\
	49.6 &=& 50\sin(\theta)\\
	\frac{49.6}{50} &=& \sin(\theta)\\
	\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{49.6}{50}\right) &=& \theta\\
	82.75^\circ & \approx &\theta
}
\]
Thus, we find that we need to *almost* launch straight up!
