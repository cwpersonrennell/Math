# Welcome

This site is structured around the course I teach at the University of Arizona, Math 120R - Calculus Preparation. Before we begin, I am going to restate the course goals here as I will occasionally make reference to these when it comes to motivating certain topics and approaches:

> - To prepare students to be successful in the Calculus sequence at U of A (math 122A/B, 129, and 223).
> - To help students develop and refine basic algebra skills by way of an integrated review of these skills as they are needed in the course.
