<p>Example: When studying outbreaks, it is not always obvious when the first day of infection occurs in a population. A researcher in the field observed that when they first arrived, there were 40 people infected in the population. Two days later, that number jumped to 120. Using the model \(I=Pe^{{rt}}\), determine the relative rate of infection as well as an approximation for the number of days since the first infection.</p>
