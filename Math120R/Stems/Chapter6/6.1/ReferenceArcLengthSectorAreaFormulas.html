<p>Arc Length of a Circle: Given \(\theta\) measured in&nbsp;<em>radians</em> in a circle with radius \(r\), the arc length, \(s\), is given by the formula:</p>
<p>\[s=r\theta\]</p>
<p>Sector Area of a Circle: Given a central angle \(theta\) measured in radians subtending a sector of a circle with radius \(r\), the area of the sector is given by the formula:</p>
<p>\[A = \dfrac{{1}}{{2}}\theta r^2\]</p>
