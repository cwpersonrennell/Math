<p>When we are working on questions that are modeled in real situations, whether geometric, financial, physics, chemistry or otherwise, there are some general procedures we can follow to better grasp the problem, break it down, and ultimately answer the questions posed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the problem carefully; if variables are provided note what they are, what they represent, and any units associated with them.</li>
<li>If applicable, draw (or interpret drawing already provided) the problem out. Label all variables provided and, if necessary, add your own variables to complete the picture.</li>
<li>Write down any relevant formulas for the situation. This may be geometric, financial, physics, etc.</li>
<li>Identify the formula which most clearly answers the question posed. Rewrite it in the variables you identified in the second part.</li>
<li>If your formula relies on variables which are undesirable (typically the ones you introduced to complete the figure) identify other formulas which can be used to eliminate that variable.</li>
<li>Substitute variables back into the desired formula and simplify the result.</li>
</ul>
