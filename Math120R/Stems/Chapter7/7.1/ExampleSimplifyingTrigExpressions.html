	In order to simplify, I will use the method of converting everything to Sine and Cosine. Note that this method is <strong>not</strong> always the most efficient method for solving and sometimes it is <strong> better </strong> to leave the other trig functions in place. However, it is a "safe" method in that usually you can make some progress in rewriting the expression, and it comes up as the best method in a large number of circumstances.

	\[
	\solve{
		\cos\theta\cot\theta+\sin\theta &=& \cos\theta\left(\frac{\cos\theta}{\sin\theta}\right)+\sin\theta\\
		&=&\frac{\cos^2\theta}{\sin\theta}+\sin\theta\\
		&=&\frac{\cos^2\theta}{\sin\theta}+\frac{\sin^2\theta}{\sin\theta}\\
		&=&\frac{\cos^2\theta+\sin^2\theta}{\sin\theta}\\
		&=&\frac{1}{\sin\theta}\\
		&=&\csc\theta
	}
	\]
	Note the final step: when simplifying the trig expression, we want to eliminate any fractions we can, even if that means using the reciprocal function!
