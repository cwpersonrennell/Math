<p>Example: A certain over the counter cold medication works on the body over the course of a few hours. Our bodies naturally break down and eventually remove all of the drug from our system, and the amount \(A\), in mg, that remains in our body after \(t\) hours since ingesting it, can be modeled by the equation \(A(t)=50(0.83)^t\). Answer each question.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the initial dose?</li>
<li>What percent of the drug does the body metabolize each hour? (this is the <i>decay rate of the drug</i>)</li>
<li>How much of the drug remains in the body after four hours?</li>
<li>How long after taking the dose does it take until there is only 1 mg remaining in the body?</li>
</ol>
