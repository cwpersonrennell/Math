<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>To solve this question is effectively the same as solving any inequality. In this case, since the directions reference "positive", we are solving \(f(x) \gt 0\). Note that 0 is *not* included. <br><br>Now, there is a "trick" to this problem which makes this a tiny bit easier: the denominator \(27(3x+4)^2\) is <strong>always</strong> positive! We still need to note that there is a domain restriction at \(x= -\frac{4}{3}\), but otherwise we are done with the denominator. </p><p>What remains now is to find the zeros from the numerator and then to identify the possible intervals for the solution: 
	\[
	\solve{
		x^2+x-12 &=&0\\
		(x-3)(x+4)&=&0
	}
	\]
So, \(x=-4\) and \(x=3\) are the zeros while \(x=-\frac{4}{3}\) is the domain restriction. Thus, the intervals of consideration are \((-\infty, -4)\),\(\left(-4,-\frac{4}{3}\right)\), \(\left(-\frac{4}{3},3\right)\), and \((3,\infty)\). After applying test values and checking for positive outcomes, you should determine that the intervals where the function is positive are \((-\infty,-4)\cup(3,\infty)\). </p>

<p>Finally, we can see this visually when we consider the graph of the function (though the exact answers may not necessarily be so easily determined from a graph on all questions).</p>

<p>Bonus Answer</p> This function is negative on \(\left(-4,-\frac{4}{3}\right)\cup\left(-\frac{4}{3},3\right)\). Notice that we *still* need to exclude the domain restriction!!
