<p>Reminder: parallel lines, by definition <strong>never</strong> intersect (think train tracks). Perpendicular lines do intersect, but they must intersect at right angles (90 degrees).</p>
<p>When we consider the equation of lines, there are some standard properties related to the slope of parallel or perpendicular lines:</p>
<p><strong>Parallel Lines:</strong>The slope of parallel lines are exactly equal: \(m_1 = m_2\) where \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) are the slopes of the parallel lines.</p>
<p><strong>Perpendicular Lines:</strong>The slope of perpendicular lines are opposite reciprocals: \(m_1=-\frac{{1}}{m_2}\) where \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) are the slopes of the perpendicular lines</p>
