<p>Given the function \(f(z) = 2-3z^2\), determine the following:</p>
<p>A) The <strong>net change</strong> between \(z=-2\) and \(z=0\).</p>
<p>B) The <strong>average rate of change</strong> between \(z=-2\) and \(z=0\)</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Net change is the vertical change, as you trace the function from left to right. This means we need to calculate the <strong>rightmost</strong> value minus the other. Thus, our calculation boils down to:</p>
\[ \begin{{array}}{{rcl}} f(0)-f(-2) &amp;=&amp; 2-3(0)^2 - (2-3(-2)^2)\\ f(0)-f(-2) &amp;=&amp; 2 - (2-3(4))\\ f(0)-f(-2) &amp;=&amp; 2 - (-10)\\ &amp;=&amp;12 \end{{array}} \]
<p>For part B), the average rate of change is the net change divided by the horizontal change, in this case we went from -2 to 0 which is a change of 2, so the average rate of change is just \(12/2 = 6\)</p>
