<p>
	Recall that "relative rate" always refers to the rate of the continuous exponential model, \(A=Pe^{rt}\). In order to convert the relative rate into the annual rate, we will set this equal to the annual rate formula, \(A=P(1+r)^t\) and then solve for the annual rate, \(r\):
	\[
	\solve{
		Pe^{0.0325t}&=&P(1+r)^t\\
		e^{0.0325t}&=&(1+r)^t\\
		\left(e^{0.0325t}\right)^\frac{1}{t}&=&1+r\\
		e^{0.0325}&=&1+r\\
		e^{0.0325}-1 &=&r\\
		r&\approx&3.3\%
	}
	\]
	<strong>Note:</strong> In this example, I left \(t\) in the problem, but it is equally valid (both based on how the question was asked and the nature of these types of questions) to simply let \(t=1\) and solve it that way. Either method will yield the same answer.
