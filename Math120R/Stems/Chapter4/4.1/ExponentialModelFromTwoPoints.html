<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>When answering questions like this, whether they are for lines, parabolas, or in this case, exponential functions, the strategy is almost always the same: <strong>take the given points and plug them into the function</strong>. Once we do so, we may have a couple of equations, but we can use those equations to solve for one or more of the parameters of the model:
\[\solve{
	1 &=&C\cdot B^0\\
	1&=&C\cdot (1)\\
	1&=&C
}
\]
In this case, the first point we plug in actually <strong> solves</strong> for the variable \(C\), which is quite helpful. However, this should make sense because \(C\) should always be the vertical intercept of the exponential function. Using the fact that \(C=1\), we continue with the second point:
\[
\solve{
	\frac{1}{9}&=&B^{-2}\\
	\frac{1}{9}&=&\frac{1}{B^2}\\
	B^2&=&9\\
	B&=&\pm3\\
	B&=&3
}
\]When solving for the Base of an exponential model, recall that the base <strong>must </strong> be positive, so we reject any negative solutions. Now that we have our parameters, we can write our final answer:
\[
f(x)=3^x
\] </p>
